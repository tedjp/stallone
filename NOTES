Network Address Translation Port Mapping (NATPM) comes in multiple parts.

SERVER

The server provides actual port mapping, and is intended to be run on a device
providing NAT ("the router").

The server is implemented as a separate daemon in two parts. One part is a
privileged helper that executes a pre-defined helper script. The helper
script carries out the commands required to modify the system's port
forwardings. On Linux, it executes iptables commands.

Interfaces will be monitored for changes by communicating with an existing
avahi-daemon.


CLIENT

The client 


LIBRARY


IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation plan is split into ordered phases as follows.

- Implementation of NAT-PMP server.
- Implementation of NAT-PMP client in avahi-daemon. Interface exposed through
  D-Bus.

At this point there will be a working application set. The library API will
hopefully be stable, however it is likely that it will change once UPnP
support is added.


FUTURE WORK

- C Library for port mapping.
- Implementation of UPnP client in avahi-daemon.
