Stallone uses the familiar autotools sequence to build.

If you check out this source from a repository, you will need to have
autoconf & automake installed. Then run:
  autoreconf

If you get a message about missing files, run
  autoreconf --install

Those who download a tarball (.tar.gz) or are building from a source
repository checkout should run the following commands to build.

  ./configure
  make

Use `./configure --help` to see build-time configuration options.

To install, run `make install`. You will probably need root privileges
to do this (eg. using sudo).

# vim: tw=72
