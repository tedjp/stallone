INSTALLING STALLONE
-------------------

Stallone uses the GNU autotools to build itself.  If you
downloaded the Stallone source code and wish to compile it
yourself simply follow the steps below.

Dependencies
------------
Ensure that your system has the following dependencies installed
prior to building Stallone.

autoconf
automake
asciidoc

Building Stallone
-----------------

./autogen.sh   (required for initial Git clones of source code)
./configure    (./configure --help will show build-time options)
make

Installing Stallone
-------------------

'make install'

OR

'sudo make install'

Beware that this will install a default configuration file (natpmd.conf)
which could overwrite an existing configuration file if one exists.

By default Stallone installs itself in the /usr/local directory tree.
The main Stallone config file can be found in
'/usr/local/etc/stallone/natpmd.conf'.

You can read more about Stallone configuration from the man page that is
installed with 'man stallone'.
