Stallone uses GNU autotools to build. The familiar
`./configure && make` commands are used to compile.

In addition, checkouts from Git (rather than from a .tar.gz archive)
will first require running `./autogen.sh` to create some initial
files. You will need autoconf & automake installed for this step.

Use `./configure --help` to see build-time configuration options.

To install, run `make install`. You will probably need root privileges
to do this (eg. using sudo). Beware that this will install a default
configuration file (natpmd.conf) which could overwrite an existing
configuration file if one exists.
