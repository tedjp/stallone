Stallone uses the familiar autotools sequence to build. The familiar
`./configure && make` commands are used to compile.

In addition, checkouts from source (rather than from a .tar.gz archive)
will first require running `./bootstrap.sh` to create some initial
files. You will need autoconf & automake installed for this step.

Use `./configure --help` to see build-time configuration options.

To install, run `make install`. You will probably need root privileges
to do this (eg. using sudo).
